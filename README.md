# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview of Project
This project allows users to visualize earthquake data in various ways. Deliverable 1 shows earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plates' location on Earth. Deliverable 2 displays all the the earthquakes with magnitudes greater than 4.5. Deliverable 3 provides the same data on different map styles.
